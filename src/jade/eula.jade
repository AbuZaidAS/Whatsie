              p The Software automatically communicates with Alexandru Rosianu's server(s) for three purposes: (1) updating the Software; (2) sending error reports; and (3) sending anonymized usage data so I may improve the Software.

If you do not want to send crash reports to Alexandru Rosianu, you may opt out by changing your settings in the Software menu.
